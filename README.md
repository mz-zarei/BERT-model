# STAT 946 Deep Learning Data Challenge: Sentence Reording

In the BERT training process, the model receives pairs of sentences as input and learns to predict if the second sentence in the pair is the subsequent sentence in the original document. In this competition, we will tackle a more complex task. Each sample in the dataset contains 6 consecutive sentences from a document where they shuffled randomly. The task is predicting the correct order of the sentences. In the train dataset, you have access to the correct order of the sentences and for the test dataset, you must predict this order for each sample.

Task:
1- Download all parts of the dataset from the data section.
2- Train your neural network using the train dataset.
3- Predict the correct order of sentences in the test data and submit your prediction file. You can find a sample submission file and its format in the data section (Note that later you also need to submit your codes in Learn and your submission file must be reproducible by your code)
